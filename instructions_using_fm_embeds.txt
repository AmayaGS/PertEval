The different files/code that need to be changed to use foundation model embeddings to generate results. Assuming you already have the control and pert embeddings.

in mlp_norman_train.yaml line 18 change fm to your foundation model name e.g. for scgpt have  fm: "scgpt"

in mlp_norman_train.yaml line 11 change total_genes to the embedding dim of your data e.g for an embd dim of 512 we have total_genes: 512 

change the path in cluster.yaml, line 7, scratch_dir so it points to your scratch (assuming your data files are in scratch)

check line 10 in cluster.yaml to make sure your embeddings data are in this dir 

make sure path to embeddings is correct in perturb_dataset.py (around 254, 256 code shown below)
else:
    with gzip.open(f"{self.data_path}/{self.data_name}_{self.fm}_fm_ctrl.pkl", "rb") as f:  #TODO fm embed load here need the right names
        fm_ctrl_data = pkl.load(f)
    with gzip.open(f"{self.data_path}/{self.data_name}_{self.fm}_fm_pert.pkl", "rb") as f:
        fm_pert_data = pkl.load(f)

Note that in the above self.fm referes to the name for fm you set in mlp_norman_train.yaml 
self.data_path is the data_dir set above ()
